Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis
SKY130RTL D1SK1 L1 Introduction to iverilog design test bench
In the first lecture of the course, we learnt about the definitions of the RTL Design, Simulator and Test Bench. The simulator we are going to use in this workshop is iverilog. After the definitions of the terms mentioned above, we learnt the workings of Simulator and Test Bench.
Simulator Working:
            Simulator looks for the changes in the input and for every change in the input, we observe changes in the output. 
Test Bench:
             Test Bench generates the stimulus for the design and observes the output.
